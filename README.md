# Project Description 
This project showcases the CSS skills we development in our third week at Codespace. Shown in this repo are custom-styled buttons using CSS, featuring various styles and effects. 

# Changes made 
## Metallic Pink Button
 This button has a metallic gradient background. On hover, the background changes to pink, and the border color adjusts. I love the metallic effect and the smooth hover transition, which make this button visually appealing.
## Neon Purple Button
This button sports a neon purple background with yellow text and borders. Hovering makes the background transparent, enhancing the neon effect.
## Blue-Orange Gradient Button
This button has a gradient from blue to orange and rotates 360 degrees when hovered over. The rotation effect on hover adds a unique and dynamic element to the button, making it the most challenging and my favorite part of the project.

# Challenges
I struggled with time management and making effective use of the starter code. However, I achieved the desired outcomes and created buttons that I'm particularly proud of and i hope that they meet the requirements.
